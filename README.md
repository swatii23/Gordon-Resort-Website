As this is our second project work on this course journey but we were not fimiliar with each other so our first day gone in discussion about how should we start, who did which work  and what are our strength and weaknesses regarding this. On next day finally we decided our role and distributed the respective work.
On the second day we started with a small discussion and decided the deadline to complete the whole project and start working on it, In evening stand-up we discussed our challenges and problem and tried to resolve them.
For next three days we have the same routine and finally on the sixth day our given task is ready but when we merge the all parts and resolved some minor bugs that were highlighted after merging.
There were some changes that need to be done and we all did it and finally, we record our presentation and Submit.
